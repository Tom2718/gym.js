# Creating a New Environment

Creating a new environment is as simple as created a file that implements the `Env` class. It should thus have the `step`, `reset`, `render`, `close`, and `seed` methods.

The environment can be created using any framework. Some of the examples here are created with [Phaser](), a JavaScript game engine.
